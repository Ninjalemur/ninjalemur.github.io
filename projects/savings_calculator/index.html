This spreadsheet takes into account Singapore’s specific income tax and pension (CPF) values to provide more locally relevant estimates. By using this tool, I hope that you can gain a better understanding of your retirement savings needs and make informed decisions about your financial future.</p> <p><a href="#Contents">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="why-google-sheets">Why Google Sheets?</h2> <p>The Savings Calculator Spreadsheet was created using Google Sheets as the tool of choice. One maing reason was that it would be free for me to develop, free for me to distribute, and free for users to use. Additionally, using Google Sheets instead of a web application and database ensures that the user’s data is kept under their control, without giving me or a third party access to any of it. This is an essential feature as people would be keying in their own financial information to do their planning.</p> <p>As a security consideration, I have also chosen not to use any scripts in the calculator. I wouldn’t feel safe enabling scripts on a spreadsheet from some guy on the internet before keying in financial data, and neither should you.</p> <p><a href="#Contents">Back to Top</a></p> <h2 id="getting-your-copy-of-the-savings-calculator">Getting your copy of the Savings Calculator</h2> <p>Once you have opened the public copy of the Savings Calculator, go to “File” &gt; “Make a copy” to make a copy for yourself.

This will reduce the amount that is withdrawn from the portfolio to support retirement</li> <li>At each person’s <strong>death</strong> age, they will stop withdrawing their share of expenses.</li> </ol> <p>Note that three years of retirement expenses (adjusted for inflation) are held as cash. In case of an economic downturn, this pool of cash aims to reduce the need to sell assets from your portfolio during a downturn.</p> <h2 id="the-plan-tab">The Plan tab</h2> <p>The Plan tab is where the action happens.

This is one of the main charts I look at to assess how comfortable I am with the amount of savings entered into the plan.</p> <p>In the chart above, we have a fairly comfortable amount of savings, with withdrawal rates gradually increasing from around 2.5% to 3% over the course of retirement. The initial temporary spike is when we are withdrawing exclusively from the portfolio before CPF life kicks in. With CPF Life paying out, we need to withdraw less from our portfolio, and have a lower withdrawal rate.</p> <p>If we don’t have sufficient savings to support our retirement income, the chart will trend upwards towards 100% or more, then drop to negative once the portfolio is depleted. In less drastic situations, the withdrawal rate might creep up over time to uncomfortable levels (eg 50%). These situations are undesirable, as they signal a high chance of running out of retirement savings, either with or without a market downturn.</p> <p>There are different schools of though around how to manage withdrawal rates over one’s lifetime. Some feel it’s appropriate to deplete your savings just before you die, and so 50-100% withdrawal rate in your final year is acceptable. Others prefer to be able to keep their withdrawal rates below 4%. Selecting an acceptable withdrawl rate is a whole topic in and of itself, and we won’t delve into it here.</p> <p>To lower withdrwal rates and increase the chances of our retirement savings lasting through retirement, there are several options</p> <ul> <li>Savings Strategy independent <ul> <li>Retire later</li> <li>Lower retirement income</li> </ul> </li> <li>Free Cash Strategy <ul> <li>Increase your salary</li> <li>Increase your salary increment</li> <li>Reduce your pre-retirement expenses</li> </ul> </li> <li>Savings Committment Strategy <ul> <li>Increase the amount you save each month or year</li> <li>Increase your savings increment</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>On the flip side, it’s possible that you might find that you have a withdrawal rate that is very low (less than 2%) and getting lower over time. This suggests that your savings are growing at a rate faster than your inflation-adjusted retirement income consumes. This suggests that you have some financial leeway that you can make use of. Essentially, you have the liberty of experimenting with doing the opposite of what we outlined previously.</p> <ul> <li>Savings Strategy independent <ul> <li>Retire earlier</li> <li>Increase retirement income</li> </ul> </li> <li>Free Cash Strategy <ul> <li>Have a lower salary</li> <li>Have a lower salary increment</li> <li>Increase your pre-retirement your expenses</li> </ul> </li> <li>Savings Committment Strategy <ul> <li>Reduce the amount you save each month or year</li> <li>Reduce your savings increment</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="savings-value-chart">Savings Value Chart</h2> <p>Next we have a chart that shows how much is in our savings portfolio each year, broken down into Cash (our 3 year buffer), Low Risk Assets, and High Risk Assets.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_value-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_value-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_value-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_value.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Do note that the numbers are not inflation adjusted (ie they are nominal).</p> <p>Usually, we expect to see the chart trending upwards as it keeps up with inflation over time. If the chart goes flat or trends down, there’s a risk that our portfolio isn’t growing enough to outpace inflation, and we might be at a higher risk of running out of funds. This visual is less sensitive to diagnosing overall sustainability than the Withdrawal Rate chart, so definitely don’t skip over that.</p> <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2> <p>Finally, we have a chart that shows how much we contribute to our retirement savings each year.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_contributions-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_contributions-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_contributions-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/savings_calc/savings_calc_savings_contributions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>This chart is useful if you are planning for two people, and you might retire at different times. It will give a sense of how the savings contributions evolve over time.</p> <h1 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h1> <h2 id="income-tax-rates-and-no-capital-gains-tax">Income tax rates and no capital gains tax</h2> <p>This calculator is tailored for the Singapore context, so Singapore personal income tax rates are used for the income tax calculation in the Free Cash Strategy.</p> <p>Singapore also has no capital gains tax, so these are not factored in to the calculator.</p> <h2 id="return-rates-of-assets">Return Rates of assets</h2> <p>The calculator accepts any return rates for assets that you key in. It has no ability to assess what rates are feasible or possible. Do seek formal financial guidance in this area for advice that is specific and suitable to you.</p> <h2 id="rate-of-return-is-average-and-constant">Rate of return is average and constant</h2> <p>The calculator has no ability to predict or simulate market downturns and fluctuations. It will only increment your portfolio by your selected rates of return, each year, every year. There WILL be market downturns in the future. This calculator can’t predict them and take them into account. Bear this in mind when inspecting results, as 100% high yield assets will always be the allocation that the calculator will estimate is providing the most savings.</p> <p>In reality, market fluctuations occur, and most people will want a mix of asset classes to ride out those fluctuations.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>The Retirement Savings Calculator spreadsheet allows you to estimate how much you need to save based on factors such as your desired retirement income, CPF Life Retirement Sum, as well as retirement age.</p> <p>I hope you found this calculator useful.
