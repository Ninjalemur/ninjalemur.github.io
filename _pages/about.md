I'm Gerard, a data analyst with a passion for user-centric products. With over 9 years of experience in industries including supply chain, real estate, and finance, I have built products to manage and plan real estate portfolios, product catalogues, workforce composition, and retirement savings. As a cross-functional project leader, I excel at collaborating with diverse teams to help them work effectively and efficiently towards success. I thrive in remote and asynchronous work environments that prioritize clear written communication and customer satisfaction.

In my free time, I'm a cat lover and with a passion for food, games, and early retirement. I enjoy spending time with my cats, and creating tools to help me decide where to eat, what strategies to use in games, as well as plan my savings for retirement.

Do check out my site, and feel free to connect with me on socials.
