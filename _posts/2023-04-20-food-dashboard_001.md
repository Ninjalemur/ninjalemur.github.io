## How the Food Dashboard came about

Enjoying good food with friends is a significant part of life. We've all had great food at many places over time, but it's so hard to remember places on demand. I first tried to create a list of places to eat in SimpleNote, but that was not very conducive to searching based on common criteria that we had, such as price point, cuisine, and location.

The next iteration of my food reference took the form of this Tableau Dashboard. With Tableau we can easily filter places to eat based on criteria such as price, point, cuisine, and location much more easily.Users can also visualise the places on a map, and see which places are nearby. Publishing this dashboard on Tableau public made it easy to share with friends and reference on the go.

This dashboard has certaintly sparked joy for me, and I hope it sparks joy for you too. Do check out the[Food Dashboard project page](https://www.gerardchan.com/projects/food_dashboard/) for the dashboard link and some directions on how to use the dashboard!
