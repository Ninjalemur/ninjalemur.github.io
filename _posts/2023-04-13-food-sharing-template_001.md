Places, dishes, and people in the image above are fictitious. Any resemblance to places, dishes, or people is entirely coincidental. If Jim and Sally were real, definitely follow them on social media. People who go through a chocolate fountain, two tequila towers, and pork cracklings all in a single sitting are worth having in your feed.

## Why this spreadsheet
I created the Food Sharing Template to help split the bill when eating out with friends. You know how it can be a real pain - one person pays for everything, then we all have to remember what we ordered and calculate how much to pay them back. It gets even more troublesome when there are taxes, shared dishes, some people order more than others, and some dishes are only shared between a few people. So, I created this handy spreadsheet where we can input our individual orders and shared dishes, and it automatically calculates the shared cost. This has really cut down the effort of splitting bills, and provides a handy table for everyone to check that the bill was split correctly.

I hope it helps you as much as it has helped my friends and I!
